# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Basic-Model
Here Model.py works on Brain Tumor dataset from Kaggle to determine from brain MRI images whether the brain has tumors or not.
And the BrainTumortype.py shows a model which shrinks the image from it's original size to 64*64  and applies VGGnet on that to classify the types of brain tumor the image possesses.
